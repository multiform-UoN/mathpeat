*MathPeat INI Network* is a UK‑based research network dedicated to exploring the mathematics of soft porous materials, with a special focus on peatlands.  
Supported by a grant from the Isaac Newton Institute and EPSRC (Ref EP/V521929/1).

## Mathematical Challenges in Soft Growing Porous Materials

MathPeat invites mathematicians, applied scientists, and curious minds to delve into the intriguing dynamics of fluid flows, non‑linear mechanics, bio‑ecological models, and multiscale analysis to study soft growing porous materials.

By focusing on the mathematical foundations of these materials, we strive to comprehend and predict their behaviour, unraveling fundamental scientific questions.

## Mathematics of Porous Media

MathPeat seeks to build a UK mathematical community focused on porous media across traditional boundaries. By bringing together experts in fluid mechanics, numerical analysis, and applied mathematics, together with engineers and geoscientists, we want to establish a vibrant network that cultivates interdisciplinary breakthroughs and opens new avenues of research and collaboration.

## What is Peat?

Peat is a soft water‑saturated organic rich soil up to about 10 m thick. It holds 30% of all soil carbon, an equivalent amount to the carbon held in the atmosphere. It is a major source of atmospheric carbon and a slow carbon sink over 1000’s of years. As it evolves the organic matter decays producing methane and carbon dioxide. Growth of typical peat deposits 3–4 m thick takes about 7000–10000 years.

Significant global efforts are currently underway to restore degraded peat and reduce emissions.

## The Importance of Peatlands

Peatlands are unique ecosystems characterized by their waterlogged and organic‑rich environments. These areas play a critical role in the Earth’s carbon cycle and provide essential services such as flood regulation, carbon sequestration, and water quality maintenance. However, the mathematical understanding of peatlands and their complex dynamics is still in its infancy.

MathPeat aims to bridge this gap by developing mathematical models and simulation approaches that shed light on the behaviour of peat and similar soft porous materials.
