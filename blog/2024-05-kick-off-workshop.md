# Thurso Kick-off Workshop (May 2024)

The MATHPEAT Network officially launched in May 2024 with an exciting three-day workshop hosted at the Environmental Research Institute in Thurso. The event gathered mathematicians, physicists, environmental engineers, and peatland scientists to begin developing a common language and identifying key challenges in modelling soft, growing porous media such as peat.

## What happened

Over 20 participants attended the event from across the UK and beyond. The workshop opened with an overview of current peatland research and mathematical challenges, followed by a full-day field trip to Strathy and RSPB Forsinard. Participants observed peat structures, textures, gas emissions, and hydrological patterns — grounding the modelling work in real-world experience.

The second day focused on interactive talks and group discussions covering topics such as:
- Multiscale modelling and fluid–structure interaction
- Gas and water transport in deformable porous materials
- Numerical methods, uncertainty quantification, and software tools

The final day was dedicated to designing research collaborations, brainstorming pilot projects, and identifying data and modelling gaps. The workshop closed with a strong sense of shared purpose and concrete next steps for interdisciplinary research.

## Reflections

This event laid the foundation for future joint work, helping shape the MATHPEAT research agenda and connect researchers across disciplines. A clear enthusiasm emerged for advancing mathematical tools to support restoration, monitoring, and climate modelling in peat-rich environments.
