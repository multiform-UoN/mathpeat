# Dundee Knowledge Exchange Workshop (September 2025)

In September 2025, the University of Dundee hosted a vibrant Knowledge Exchange workshop in partnership with the University of Nottingham, bringing together early-career researchers, academics, and industry stakeholders to tackle real-world peatland modelling challenges.

## About the workshop

Held over three days, the event featured interactive sessions structured around three industrial challenges, proposed by collaborators in carbon monitoring, land restoration, and hydrology. Each challenge was taken up by interdisciplinary teams composed of PhD students, postdocs, and senior researchers.

The themes included:

### Sensor Arrays for COâ‚‚ Monitoring (CSX Carbon)
Developing models to interpret sensor data and relate it to peatland gas fluxes and water table dynamics.

### Restoration Planning and Erosion Risk (Scottish Woodlands)
Designing triage tools for large-scale decision-making on restoration investments, balancing ecological and economic factors.

### Infrastructure Impacts on Bog Pools (IMTECO Ltd)
Assessing hydrological changes caused by development near sensitive raised bog features.

## Outcomes and Impact

Each group delivered short presentations outlining their initial models, data assumptions, and future directions. The event provided space for knowledge-sharing, model prototyping, and building new collaborations across sectors. Early-career researchers played a leading role, supported by mentoring and informal discussions throughout.

This workshop not only advanced technical ideas but also deepened engagement between academia and industry â€” a key objective of the MATHPEAT network.
